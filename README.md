SCETSP: Segment Close-enough Traveling Salesman Problem

------

This repository provides a collection of SCETSP test problems, as well as the source code to solve SCETSP instances. The SCETSP is a variant of the Close-enough Traveling Salesman Problem, in which the neighborhoods of line-segment objects (and polygonal objects) are considered for close-enough visits. The code provided in this repository includes the generalized Benders decomposition implementation of this problem.
